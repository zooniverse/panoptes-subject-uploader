# Panoptes Subject Uploader Documentation

Uses [Flatdoc](https://github.com/rstacruz/flatdoc) to render `documentation.md` as a pretty formatted docs page at [https://zooniverse.github.io/panoptes-subject-uploader/](https://zooniverse.github.io/panoptes-subject-uploader/).

## Run locally for development

1. Comment out line 26 of `index.html`, and uncomment line 27, which will enable your local copy of `documentation.md`.
2. Run `make run` to start up a server at `http://localhost:8000`

Remember not to commit your changes to `index.html`!
